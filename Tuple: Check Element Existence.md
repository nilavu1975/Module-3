# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
x=("s", 8, "a", "v", "n", "w", "u", "r", "c", "g") 
print("n" in x) 
print(8 in x)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus the above python program was executed successfully.
